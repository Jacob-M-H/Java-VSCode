1.Is there a scalable pane? A property that would help me.
2. Buttons - drag/swap, click to cycle, click to add layer, add scroll bar. Make transparent all layers to the right, 
    group layers (make a smaller button that contains the others, animate to respread them)
3. Scroll pane inside another pane (H/V bars), drag if possible?
4. Get mouse position
4.5. Give translation of mouse position to the zoom/scale, and return. 
5. Give every shape a 'order', such as front or back.

6. More UI -shapes, menu bar, bring together stuff.


last. Back end, organize shapes, make selecting of lines and points possible. Perhaps make all 'shapes' point based?
Dispatch events, what if we have two hoverable shapes? How can I make each pixel a 'hoverable' entitiy? I don't want a ton of objects either...
4-tertierary tree for spliting screen objects on spawn? Each node independnelty added to the tree?
Drawing to a specific pane and track back end might be best bet tbh.
